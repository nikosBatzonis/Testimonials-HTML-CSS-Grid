                    transition and have heart some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free
                    intro
                    course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best -
                    and
                    most gruelling - time of my life. Since completing the courses, I've successfully switched careers,

                    structure
                    from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a
                    former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. THe entire curriculum
                    and
                    staff did not dissapoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The
                    agile
                    team project, in particular, was outstanding. It look my learning to the next level in a way that no
                    tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often reffered to it during interwies as an example of my
                    development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving
                    multiple offers. 100% recommend!"</p>
